TclRobots
=========
This is a development of Tim Poindexter's 1996 game TclRobots 2.0.

From TclRobots 2.0:

"TclRobots is a programming game, similar to 'Core War'.  To play
TclRobots, you must write a Tcl program that controls a robot.  The
robot's mission is to survive a battle with other robots."

TclRobots require Tcl 8.6 since it uses coroutines.
