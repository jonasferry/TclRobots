<p>This is a development of Tom Poindexter's 1996 game TclRobots 2.0.</p>

<p>From TclRobots 2.0:</p>

<blockquote>"TclRobots is a programming game, similar to 'Core War'. To play TclRobots, you must write a Tcl program that controls a robot. The robot's mission is to survive a battle with other robots."</blockquote>

<p>TclRobots require Tcl 8.6 since it uses coroutines.</p>

<h1>THE ROBOT</h1>
<!--=========-->
<p>NOTE: Most of this text refers to TclRobots 2.0.</p>

<p>All robots in TclRobots are constructed equally. What differentiates
the robots' behavior is the control program that you write. The robot
has the ability to move, look for, and shoot at, other robots.</p>

<p>Robots use a compass system based on 0 to 359 degrees, with 0
pointing due east, 90 due north, 180 due west, and 270 due south.</p>

<p>The robot's drive mechanism can be controlled to move the robot in a
particular direction, at some speed. Direction is expressed as an
integer degree heading 0 - 359, and speed is 0 to 100 percent. The motor
is inefficient above 35% speed, and begins to overheat. When a
temperature heat index of 200 is reached, the motor cannot be operated
over 35% until cooling allows the heat index to drop back to 0. While
the robot is very agile and stable, safeguards are built into the
interface to prevent the robot from tipping over while trying to turn at
too fast a rate for any given speed.</p>

<p>The following table represents maximum speeds at which a delta course
change can be made:</p>
<pre>
Degrees of     Maximum Speed
course change
____________________________
25 or less         100%
25 - 50             50%
50 - 75             30%
75 or greater       20%
</pre>
<p>If a course change is attempted at a speed above the maximum for the
change, the drive is disengaged (speed set to 0) on the present
course. The drive mechanism also allows the robot to turn faster at
slower speeds.</p>
<pre>
Speed         Rate of turn
____________________________
25% or less       90
25 - 50%          60
50 - 75%          40
75% or greater    30
</pre>
<p>At 100% speed, the robot travels at 20 meters per second. Robots are
also subject to acceleration and deaccelearation, a linear constant of
20% of the maximun speed per second.</p>

<p>Each robot is equipped with a scanning device, which can be pointed
independently of the current drive heading of the robot. A scan can be
initiated in any direction, 0-359 degrees. The scanner has a variable
resolution capability, detecting other robots within a maximum of +/- 10
degrees from the scan direction. If a scan finds a robot, the distance
to the opposing robot is reported. However, if a resolution greater than
0 is used, the scanner's result may be reported inaccurately. In this
case, the distance reported may be off by as much as 10 meters for each
degree of resolution (up to 100 meters in error for a +/- 10 degree
resolution scan.) A high resolution scan (0 specified for resolution)
will return accurate results, subject to cannon barrel heat distortion
(see below).</p>

<p>If two or more robots are in the scan's resolution, the closest
opponent is reported. It's also possible to distinguish various opposing
robots, as the scanner has a rudimentary digital signal processor, and
each robot has a arbitrary signature. A robot program can also be
alerted when it is the subject of a scan by another robot. The signature
of the scanning robot can be determined, but not it's heading or
distance.</p>

<p>A cannon is the robot's offensive weapon, firing a shell at opposing
robots. The cannon has a maximum range of 700 meters, and can be aimed
independently of the robot heading. Damage to all surrounding robots
from an exploding shell is assessed as follows:</p>
<pre>
Meters from   % Damage
 explosion    incurred
______________________
     6          25%
    10          12%
    20           7%
    40           3%
</pre>
<p>While the robot has an large (unlimited) cache of shells available,
it can only reload fast enough to have one shell in the air at maximum
range at any one time (approximately 4 seconds). Cannon shells are
grouped four to a clip; after a clip is exhausted, it is ejected and a
new clip loaded in place. The effect is that on every fourth shell, the
reload time is tripled (12 seconds.) The cannon fires its shells in a
high arc; a shell will not impact into another robot that might be in
the line of flight. Shells travel at 200 meters per second toward the
target.</p>

<p>Each shell fired causes the cannon barrel to heat up. The heat rising
off the barrel distorts the view of the scanner. If the temperature of
the barrel becomes too great, the scanner is rendered useless. At lesser
temperatures, the heat distortion will cause the scanner to return
inaccurate results, a random plus or minus meters equal to the total
heat of the barrel (one unit of barrel heat = one meter error.) Firing a
shell causes the barrel temperature to increase by 20 heat units. The
normal cooling rate is 2 units per second. The scanner always reports 0
for range while the barrel temperature is above 35 units. The scanning
beam, however, still registers upon other robots in the path of the
scan, triggering a scanned robot's alert procedure. The cannon barrel
does not have temperature sensor.</p>

<p>Various feedback registers in the robot can be accessed by the
control program, reporting the current amount of damage, x and y axis
battlefield location, current speed, and an internal clock tick.</p>

<p>Robots incur damage expressed as a percent value. When 100% damage is
reached, the robot is "dead", and ceases to function. However, damage
has no effect on operational ability. A robot with 99% damage operates
as well as one with no damage.</p>
